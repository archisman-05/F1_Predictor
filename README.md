# F1_Predictor

Overview:
F1 Predictor is a machine learning-based tool designed to predict the finishing positions of drivers in the Australian Grand Prix 2025. By leveraging historical race data, driver performance statistics, track conditions, and other relevant factors, this model aims to provide accurate predictions for the upcoming race.

Features:
1. Predicts driver finishing positions for the Australian Grand Prix 2025.
2. Uses machine learning algorithms trained on historical race data.
3. Incorporates multiple factors such as driver stats, team performance, weather, and track conditions.
4. Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting custom race parameters.
5. Generates probability-based rankings to assess prediction confidence.

Installation:
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.x
2. pip (Python package manager)
3. Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive usage)
4. fastf1
